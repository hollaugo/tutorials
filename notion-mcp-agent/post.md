## Advanced Features

### Context Engineering: The 5-Layer Approach

Our agent uses a sophisticated context-building process:

**Layer 1: Discovery**
```python
# Broad workspace search
results = search_workspace_context("customer support", "all")
```

**Layer 2: Analysis** 
```python
# Understand structure and patterns
for db in results:
    schema = get_database_schema(db["id"])
    insights = get_database_insights(db["id"])
```

**Layer 3: Retrieval**
```python
# Get specific detailed information
tickets = query_database_advanced(
    database_id, 
    filters={"Status": {"equals": "Open"}},
    sorts=[{"Priority": "descending"}]
)
```

**Layer 4: Synthesis**
```python
# Combine insights for comprehensive understanding
context = synthesize_workspace_context(results, insights, tickets)
```

**Layer 5: Action**
```python
# Execute context-aware operations
action_plan = generate_contextual_actions(context)
execute_intelligent_operations(action_plan)
```

### Intelligent Pattern Recognition

The agent learns from your workspace patterns:

```python
def analyze_productivity_patterns(workspace_data):
    """Identify workflow bottlenecks and optimization opportunities"""
    patterns = {
        "bottlenecks": find_status_bottlenecks(workspace_data),
        "high_performers": identify_efficient_workflows(workspace_data),
        "optimization_opportunities": suggest_improvements(workspace_data)
    }
    return patterns
```

### Predictive Analytics

Generate insights about future trends:

```python
def predict_sprint_capacity(historical_data):
    """Predict team capacity based on historical performance"""
    velocity_trend = calculate_velocity_trend(historical_data)
    capacity_forecast = forecast_team_capacity(velocity_trend)
    return capacity_forecast
```

## Optimization Tips

### Performance Optimization

**1. Context Caching**
```python
@lru_cache(maxsize=100)
def get_cached_database_insights(database_id):
    return get_database_insights(database_id)
```

**2. Batch Operations**
```python
# Instead of individual updates
for page_id in page_ids:
    update_page(page_id, properties)

# Use bulk operations
bulk_update_database(database_id, updates, filter_criteria)
```

**3. Async Processing**
```python
import asyncio

async def process_multiple_requests(requests):
    tasks = [process_request(req) for req in requests]
    return await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```

### Cost Optimization

**1. Smart Token Management**
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Use context summarization for long conversations
- Implement request deduplication

**2. Efficient Prompting**
```python
# Instead of verbose prompts
prompt = f"Please analyze this database and provide comprehensive insights about {database_info}"

# Use structured, concise prompts
prompt = f"Database: {db_name}\nTask: Analyze productivity metrics\nFormat: JSON with insights, bottlenecks, recommendations"
```

### Reliability Improvements

**1. Robust Error Handling**
```python
from tenacity import retry, stop_after_attempt, wait_exponential

@retry(
    stop=stop_after_attempt(3),
    wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=4, max=10)
)
def resilient_api_call(endpoint, data):
    return make_api_request(endpoint, data)
```

**2. Circuit Breaker Pattern**
```python
class CircuitBreaker:
    def __init__(self, failure_threshold=5, recovery_timeout=30):
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.recovery_timeout = recovery_timeout
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.last_failure_time = None
        self.state = 'CLOSED'  # CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: MCP Server fails to start
```bash
Error: Port 8006 already in use
```
**Solution**:
```bash
# Find process using port 8006
lsof -i :8006
# Kill the process
kill -9 <PID>
# Restart server
python server.py
```

**Issue**: Slack bot not responding to mentions
**Symptoms**: Bot appears online but doesn't respond to @mentions
**Solution**:
1. Verify Socket Mode is enabled
2. Check app-level token has `connections:write` scope
3. Ensure bot is added to channel: `/invite @NotionAgent`

**Issue**: Agent gives generic responses
**Symptoms**: Responses lack specific workspace context
**Solution**:
1. Verify Notion integration has database access
2. Check databases are properly shared with integration
3. Test MCP server endpoints directly:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8006/health
```

**Issue**: High API costs
**Symptoms**: Unexpected OpenAI API charges
**Solution**:
1. Implement response caching:
```python
import redis
redis_client = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379)

def cached_llm_call(prompt):
    cache_key = hashlib.md5(prompt.encode()).hexdigest()
    cached_response = redis_client.get(cache_key)
    if cached_response:
        return json.loads(cached_response)
    
    response = make_llm_call(prompt)
    redis_client.setex(cache_key, 3600, json.dumps(response))  # 1 hour cache
    return response
```

2. Set usage limits:
```python
# Add to .env
OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS_PER_REQUEST=1000
DAILY_REQUEST_LIMIT=100
```

### Debug Mode

Enable comprehensive logging:

```bash
# Set debug environment
export PYTHONPATH=.
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

# Run with detailed logging
python -m uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8006 --log-level debug
```

## Monitoring and Analytics

### LangSmith Integration

Track agent performance:

```python
from langsmith import traceable

@traceable
def process_user_request(user_input):
    # Your agent logic here
    response = agent.invoke(user_input)
    return response
```

### Custom Metrics

Track business-specific metrics:

```python
import time
from collections import defaultdict

class AgentMetrics:
    def __init__(self):
        self.request_counts = defaultdict(int)
        self.response_times = []
        self.success_rates = defaultdict(list)
    
    def record_request(self, request_type, response_time, success):
        self.request_counts[request_type] += 1
        self.response_times.append(response_time)
        self.success_rates[request_type].append(success)
    
    def get_summary(self):
        return {
            "total_requests": sum(self.request_counts.values()),
            "avg_response_time": sum(self.response_times) / len(self.response_times),
            "success_rate": sum(all_successes) / len(all_successes) 
                for all_successes in [sum(self.success_rates.values(), [])]
        }
```
